- Sampling Fixed Effects
  + per outcome
  + center/standardize X matrices
  + hierarchical centering
  + optimal scaling covariance matrix proposal [1]

- Sampling Scale Parameters
  + per outcome

- Sampling Random Effects
  + all outcomes together, and for all subjects in one step
  + optimal scaling covariance matrix proposal (block-diagonal)

- Sampling Covariance Matrix Random Effects
  + split to variances and correlation matrix
  + sample variances using rstanarm trace-simplex representation
  + sample correlation matrix using LKJ prior

- Sampling Coefficients Survival Model
  + try all together
  + or separately
  + center/standardize W0, W, W_long matrices
  + optimal scaling proposal distribution(s)
